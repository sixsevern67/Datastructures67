Lab 1: Linked List Lab — Music Playlist
Lab Overview
You will build a Song class and a Playlist class backed by your linked list. The playlist supports adding songs, removing songs, and playing through the list. Estimated time: 45–60 minutes

Part A — Song Class (10 min)
Create a Song class with String fields: title, artist, and album. Give it a constructor and a toString() that returns a nicely formatted string.

Part B — SongNode Class (10 min)
Modify the Node concept to store a Song instead of an int. Create a SongNode class with a Song data field and a SongNode next field.

Part C — Playlist Class (30 min)
Build a Playlist class with a SongNode head. Implement:

addToFront(Song s) — adds to front
addToEnd(Song s) — adds to end of playlist
removeFirst() — removes and returns first song
playAll() — prints each song in order
size() — returns number of songs
